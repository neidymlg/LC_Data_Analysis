# LC_Data_Analysis
This is a SQL data analysis conducted on Postgresql. This data analysis involves probability formulas such as Bayes Theroem and Conditional Probability in order to gauge what the probability is for having a condition and Lung Cancer and etc. In addition, I have included an additional SQL file that details the basics of SQL commands.

Based on my findings, the data might be biased, as there is a high chance of having a somewhat unrelated condition and Lung Cancer. This is probably due to the fact that this data contains equal amount of patients who do not have lung cancer and who do have lung cancer.
